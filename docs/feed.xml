&lt;p&gt;First lets talk about the -f flag, I added it initially as it helped when testing new ideas but quickly realised it could be beneficial to others when I started exploring the image and capabilities commands. I actually found it really cool to be able to read a list of image names from yaml files without having to resort to opening the file or using grep to get the image list. With that in place it was a no-brainer to to add the ability to read piped data so it could be used with helm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which then allows things like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;helm template mychart | kubectl-ice image
helm get manifest mychart | kubectl-ice image
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I envision this as more of a safety check in a pipeline or maybe even used in a reporting process to list the ports or images used, when combined with the column flag below it has the potential to be very powerful and useful but only time will tell…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;--columns&lt;/code&gt; flag, which when specified this flag accept a comma separated list of column names to show, the advantage here is only those specified columns are shown in the table output and you can specify any valid column even those that are hidden by default, given the image command you could create something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl-ice image --columns podname,image,imageid
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;would show a list of pod names with the image name and along with the sha of the image
the only down side of this is that the column order is set but the program and now the user so you have no control over the column order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s me for now and I hope this has been useful.&lt;/p&gt;
